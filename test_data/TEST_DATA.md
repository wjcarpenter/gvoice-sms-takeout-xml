# Test data

The files under here are for limited regression testing.
I hope they cover all interesting cases,
but it's difficult to say for sure.
The directory structure represents an unpacked Google Takeout archive,
so the interesting stuff is under `Takeout/Voice/Calls/`.
If you run the script from that directory and the default options,
the output files will end up here (the same directory as this file).

The data came mostly from actual Google Takeout files,
but the contact names and numbers have been faked for privacy.
Likewise, the attachment files have been munged, 
which also makes them a lot smaller and easier to inspect in the output files.

## Archive browser
The file <archive_browser.html> is a stripped down copy of an actual file from Google Takeout
with line items added for the test data.
It's just here for convenience of browsing the test data files.

## Contacts
Here are the possible contact names and numbers.
You don't need to add any of these to `contacts.json`
unless instructed to do so by the script.
Some of the contacts have multiple phone numbers,
which happens for legitimate reasons in real data.

For this test data, the Google Voice account belongs to user Maria S Curie.
